# Game Design Doc

A general design/feature document. This is more a putting some ideas in place I can find them and pretend this is a design doc ;)

## General Outline

Space Spitfires taking on Space Nazi's in an alternative ww2 history. A simple space flight sim akin to XWing / Tie games.

Currently two possible tracks might be taken.

1. A story that starts on earth and culminates in space for an epic battle.
2. A story entirely based in space.

This is partly done to finding the core game play, and partly down to creating good flight physics for the player.

## Constraints

Identifying the constraints the project exists in, and trying to live with-in those as much as possible.

- No animation support in engine (other than simple rotations in code).
- No voice acting.
- Close combat as much as possible to fit Oculus VR's low res.
- One shitty artist (and incase anybody reads this I'm referring to myself).

## General Feature List

- Single-player
- Around 1 - 2 hours of game-play
- Comic intro and cutscenes
- Play from chase camera or VR Cockpit

## Art Style Ideas

Would like to go for a bright colored space but this is getting quite common so shall experiment to see if it adds anything. May make it less black but not bright colors.

Simplisitc art.
